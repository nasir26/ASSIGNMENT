## 2. Introduction

### 2.1 Background

Corrosion monitoring is a critical aspect of integrity management for offshore oil and gas facilities. Qatar Energy operates numerous offshore platforms in the Arabian Gulf, including the PS-3 complex and Halul Island facilities. Regular corrosion monitoring helps ensure safe and reliable operation of these assets by identifying areas of accelerated metal loss before they become integrity concerns.

### 2.2 Purpose of the Survey

The primary objectives of this corrosion monitoring survey were to:

1. Retrieve installed corrosion coupons from designated monitoring locations
2. Conduct visual inspection and weight loss analysis of retrieved coupons
3. Record electrical resistance (ER) probe readings at all probe locations
4. Replace expired ER probes with new units
5. Install new corrosion coupons for continued monitoring
6. Identify any locations requiring remedial action or enhanced monitoring

## 5. General Observations

### 5.1 Equipment Condition

#### 5.1.1 Checkmate ER Probe Reader

During ER probe readings on July 9, 2025, it was observed that readings were inconsistent and required significant time to stabilize. Investigation revealed that the position of the Checkmate cable significantly affected readings, suggesting potential cable deterioration. **The Checkmate unit is approximately 12 years old and is recommended for replacement.**

#### 5.1.2 Retrieval Tools

The 25" and 37" RBS retrieval tools performed satisfactorily throughout the campaign. No significant issues were encountered with the pressure-retaining mechanisms.

### 5.2 Access Conditions

Several locations presented access challenges:

| Location | Issue | Action Required |
|----------|-------|-----------------|
| 53-XCC-1428 | Elevated level access | Permanent service platform |
| 53-XCP-1427 | Elevated level access | Permanent service platform |
| 6-GC-430036 | Protective cover jammed | Scaffolding required |
| Multiple PS-3C | Structural obstruction | Platform modification |

### 5.3 Coupon Condition Observations

The majority of retrieved coupons exhibited the following characteristics:

- Dark coloration consistent with exposure to crude oil environment
- Small amounts of soft, easily removable deposits
- No evidence of severe pitting or localized attack on most coupons
- Weight loss measurements indicate general uniform corrosion

### 5.4 Weather Impact

Work was suspended on August 24, 2025, due to rough sea conditions that prevented safe vessel operations to PS-3. Activities resumed the following day when conditions improved.

## 7. Conclusions

Based on the corrosion monitoring survey conducted at PS-3 and Halul Island facilities, the following conclusions are drawn:

### 7.1 Survey Completion

1. The corrosion monitoring survey was successfully executed between July 8 and August 25, 2025, covering the majority of planned locations at PS-3 platforms and Halul Island.

2. A total of 122 corrosion coupons were successfully retrieved from 212 planned locations, representing a **57.5% retrieval rate**.

3. Laboratory analysis has been completed for 98 coupons (46.2%), with remaining samples pending processing.

4. ER probe readings were recorded at all 36 accessible probe locations at PS-3.

### 7.2 Corrosion Assessment

1. The majority of retrieved coupons showed uniform general corrosion with dark deposits consistent with crude oil exposure.

2. **No evidence of severe pitting corrosion** or localized attack was observed on the inspected coupons.

3. Weight loss measurements indicate corrosion rates within acceptable limits for the operating environment.

4. ER probe readings showed stable corrosion rates at most locations, with some probes requiring replacement due to age.

### 7.3 Equipment and Access

1. The Checkmate ER probe reader exhibited inconsistent readings, likely due to cable degradation after 12 years of service.

2. Several locations (approximately 18.4%) could not be accessed due to:
   - Elevated positions requiring scaffolding or permanent platforms
   - Structural obstructions blocking retrieval tool access
   - Jammed protective covers

3. High-pressure locations (1500 psi) were successfully serviced using appropriate back-pressure testing procedures.

---

## 8. Recommendations

### 8.1 Immediate Actions

1. **Replace Checkmate ER Probe Reader:** The current unit is 12 years old and showing signs of cable deterioration affecting reading accuracy. A new unit should be procured before the next survey campaign.

2. **Complete Pending Coupon Analysis:** Expedite laboratory analysis of the remaining 34 coupons to complete the corrosion rate assessment.

3. **Address Jammed Access Fittings:** Location 6-GC-430036 has a jammed protective cover requiring maintenance attention.

### 8.2 Access Improvements

1. **Install Permanent Service Platforms:** Locations 53-XCC-1428 and 53-XCP-1427 require permanent service platforms for safe and efficient access during future surveys.

2. **Structural Modifications:** Review and modify structural elements that obstruct retrieval tool access at certain locations on PS-3C.

3. **Scaffolding Plan:** Develop a pre-survey scaffolding plan for elevated locations to minimize delays during future campaigns.

### 8.3 Monitoring Program Enhancements

1. **Survey Frequency:** Maintain the current 2-year survey interval for corrosion coupon retrieval and analysis.

2. **ER Probe Program:** Consider more frequent ER probe readings (quarterly or semi-annually) to track corrosion rate trends between coupon surveys.

3. **Data Management:** Implement a centralized database system for tracking coupon installation dates, weights, and analysis results.

4. **Coupon Identification:** Ensure all coupon locations are clearly tagged and documented to prevent "Not Available" designations.

### 8.4 Future Survey Planning

1. Schedule the next corrosion monitoring survey for **mid-2027**.
2. Coordinate with operations to address access issues before the next survey.
3. Pre-position scaffolding at known elevated locations.
4. Ensure adequate weather windows are planned for offshore vessel operations.
